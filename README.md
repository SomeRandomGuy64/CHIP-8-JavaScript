# CHIP-8-JavaScript

I'm developing a CHIP-8 emulator in JavaScript.

My goal with this project is to learn how an emulator works, with CHIP-8 being (supposedly) the easiest to develop this is where I will start.

I will be using this guide: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/creating-your-very-own-chip-8-emulator/

Most of the code, when done, will be from this guide here. I am also hoping to implement the features at the bottom of the guide when done.
All comments will be my own unless there is a comment already in the guide. I'll be using my comments to test my understanding of the code.

As stated earlier, this is just for my learning, I am hoping to create a CHIP-8 emulator from scratch after this in either Java or C but for now I will be developing in JavaScript using a step-by-step guide
